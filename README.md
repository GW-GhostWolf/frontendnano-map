# frontendnano-map
Project 8 for Udacity Front End Nano Degree - Neighborhood map
Initially used list of museums in San Antonio, TX for the places and later decided that a list of 
attractions at the Magic Kingdom, Disney World, FL would be more interesting.

[Magic Kingdom Attraction Map](https://gw-ghostwolf.github.io/frontendnano-map/) is hosted by [GitHub](https://www.github.com)

Code can be run locally by downloading and extracting or by cloning the repository.
